I was born in bear County. And when I was five we moved to a farm near\nWhite House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country, when my chores were done,\nI'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike to the down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope\nto a limb of a cypress tree, and it would swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water.\nI'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd\ncatch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. That's true. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn\ncobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts\nand pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store.\nI didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my\nfavorite foods fried okra. hoppin john that's rice and black eyed peas in pecan pie. We had lots of good\ntimes, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler.\nI'd rather be living on the farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't\nunderstand me. When I gripe about the city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child\nsays Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I\nknow Texas is changing, but I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live\nin a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of place and take pride in\nbeing Texans.
