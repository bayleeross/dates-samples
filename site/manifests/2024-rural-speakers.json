I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to, to a farm\nnear White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the county, country. When my\nchores were done. I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to, to the creek to to fish or swim. One\ntime we tried, we tied a rope to climb, no to a limb about a cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over\nthe, the swining hole dropping into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine, in the spring I\nfly a kite and on some, on summer nights we'd catch fireflies but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a\nwhile when, we have fights, fights with the corn, corncobs or pinecorns. In the winter, we'd build a fire in\nthe fireplace and pop popcorn and ro roast peanuts and pecans. I guess it was alive right, a life wire.\nWhen I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at Firestone Tire store. I like, I didn't like city life, and for a long\ntime I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods, fried okra, hopping\njohn. That's, that's rice and black peas and my favorite foods, fried okra. Oh again [GIGGLES], and\npecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now after daddy died, Mama\nsold the farm and moved to Tyler. I rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but\nmy wife and kids don't understand me. When I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the, to the\ncountry. My oldest child says, \" Daddy that's crazy that I just die if I if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost\ncried the first time she , she said it. I know Texas is changing but I tried to make sure we don't lose\ntouch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land.\nHave a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to, to the land, the price of\nprogress is too high.
